## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher) – required for Vite and TailwindCSS
- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli) – helps you download, upload, preview themes, and streamline your workflows

If you use VS Code:

- [Shopify Liquid VS Code Extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/shopify-liquid-vscode) – provides syntax highlighting, linting, inline documentation, and auto-completion specifically designed for Liquid templates

### Clone

Clone this repository using Git or Shopify CLI:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Shopify/skeleton-theme.git
cd skeleton-theme
```

### Install Dependencies

Install Node.js dependencies for Vite and TailwindCSS:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run both Vite dev server (with HMR) and Shopify CLI preview:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Vite dev server** on `http://localhost:5173` with Hot Module Replacement
- **Shopify CLI** theme preview with Liquid hot-reload

For more details, see [VITE_SETUP.md](./VITE_SETUP.md).

### Build for Production

Generate optimized assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Templates

[Templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates#template-types) control what's rendered on each type of page in a theme.

The Skeleton Theme scaffolds [JSON templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/json-templates) to make it easy for merchants to customize their store.

None of the template types are required, and not all of them are included in the Skeleton Theme. Refer to the [template types reference](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates#template-types) for a full list.

### Sections

[Sections](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections) are Liquid files that allow you to create reusable modules of content that can be customized by merchants. They can also include blocks which allow merchants to add, remove, and reorder content within a section.

Sections are made customizable by including a `{% schema %}` in the body. For more information, refer to the [section schema documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema).

### Blocks

[Blocks](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks) let developers create flexible layouts by breaking down sections into smaller, reusable pieces of Liquid. Each block has its own set of settings, and can be added, removed, and reordered within a section.

Blocks are made customizable by including a `{% schema %}` in the body. For more information, refer to the [block schema documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks/theme-blocks/schema).

## Schemas

When developing components defined by schema settings, we recommend these guidelines to simplify your code:

- **Single property settings**: For settings that correspond to a single CSS property, use CSS variables:

  ```liquid
  <div class="collection" style="--gap: {{ block.settings.gap }}px">
    ...
  </div>

  {% stylesheet %}
    .collection {
      gap: var(--gap);
    }
  {% endstylesheet %}

  {% schema %}
  {
    "settings": [{
      "type": "range",
      "label": "gap",
      "id": "gap",
      "min": 0,
      "max": 100,
      "unit": "px",
      "default": 0,
    }]
  }
  {% endschema %}
  ```

- **Multiple property settings**: For settings that control multiple CSS properties, use CSS classes:

  ```liquid
  <div class="collection {{ block.settings.layout }}">
    ...
  </div>

  {% stylesheet %}
    .collection--full-width {
      /* multiple styles */
    }
    .collection--narrow {
      /* multiple styles */
    }
  {% endstylesheet %}

  {% schema %}
  {
    "settings": [{
      "type": "select",
      "id": "layout",
      "label": "layout",
      "values": [
        { "value": "collection--full-width", "label": "t:options.full" },
        { "value": "collection--narrow", "label": "t:options.narrow" }
      ]
    }]
  }
  {% endschema %}
  ```

## CSS & JavaScript

### TailwindCSS v4

This theme uses **TailwindCSS v4** for styling. You can use utility classes directly in your Liquid templates:

```liquid
<div class="container mx-auto px-4">
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">{{ product.title }}</h1>
</div>
```

Customize design tokens in `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Component Styles

For component-specific styles, you can still use the [`{% stylesheet %}`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags#stylesheet) and [`{% javascript %}`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags/javascript) tags within sections. They can be included multiple times, but the code will only appear once.

### Global Styles

Global styles are defined in `src/main.css`, which includes:
- TailwindCSS base, components, and utilities
- Custom base styles (similar to the previous `critical.css`)
- Component-level styles using `@layer`
