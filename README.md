# Skeleton Theme

> **Skeleton Theme and [Slate v1](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) are currently in beta!** You should expect potentially breaking changes between updates and more bugs than a finalized release. Slate v1.0 has not yet been tested on Windows. Please note that support has ended for [Slate v1](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) as of January 2020.

## System requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with Skeleton theme:

* **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

* **NPM 5+ or Yarn:** Both of these package managers have [ups and downs](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/), choose whichever you prefer. Follow the installation instructions [for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to make sure you're using the latest version.

## Getting started

To get started with Skeleton Theme, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ yarn create slate-theme my-new-theme shopify/skeleton-theme
```

For more information on connecting your new project with a Shopify store, see the [Slate docs](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/wiki/3.-Connect-to-your-store).
