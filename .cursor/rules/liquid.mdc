<ux_principles>
  <translations>
    - Keep every piece of text in the theme translated.
    - Update the locale files with sensible keys and text.
    - Just add english text, not other languages, as we have translators on staff who handle other languages
  </translations>
  <settings>
    <general_guidance>
      Keep it simple, clear, and non-repetitive.

      - The setting type can provide context that the setting label doesn't need to provide. Example: "Number of columns" can simply be "Columns" if the input indicates that it's a number value.
      - Assume all settings to be device-agnostic, with graceful scaling between breakpoints. Only mention mobile or desktop if there is a unique setting required.
      - Use common shorthand where it makes sense. Example: Max/Min to mean Maximum and Minimum. Caveat: ensure these values are translated/localized correctly
      - Help text: Minimize use as much as possible. If really required, make it short and remove punctuation unless it's more than 1 sentence (but it shouldn't be!)
    </general_guidance>

    <information_architecture>
      <ordering>
        The order of theme settings greatly impacts the merchant's ability to understand and configure the section/block.

        - List settings to reflect the order of elements they control in the preview. Top to bottom, left to right, background to foreground.
        - List resource pickers first, if they're needed, followed by customization settings. Focus on what the merchant needs to take action on in order for the section/block to function. Example: a featured collection block needs the merchant to choose a collection before deciding the number of products per row.
        - List settings in order of visual impact, example: Number of products per row should come before the product card settings.
      </ordering>

      <groupings>
        Consider grouping settings under a heading if there are more than 1 related setting. List ungrouped settings at the top of the section/block.

        Common groupings:

        - Layout
        - Typography
        - Colors
        - Padding
      </groupings>

      <naming>
        Remove word duplication in the heading and nested labels. When a word appears in a heading (e.g. "Color"), it should not be repeated in nested setting labels or help text. The hierarchy of information provides sufficient context.
      </naming>

      <conditional>
        Use conditional settings when it:

        - simplifies decision-making for merchants via progressive disclosure
        - avoids duplication of settings
        - avoids visual clutter and reduces cognitive load

        Conditional settings should appear in the information architecture wherever they're most relevant. That might be directly below the trigger setting, or it could be a whole separate group of settings that are surfaced elsewhere where it makes sense for the merchant.

        Tradeoffs and considerations of conditional settings:

        - They hide functionality/options that help merchants decide how style their website, so be judicious in what concepts you tie together. For example, don't make a Product card's "Swatch display" setting conditional on a "Quick buy" setting. They are both related to variant selection, but they serve different purposes.
        - Limit conditions to 2 levels deep to avoid complex logic (up for discussion!)
        - Even when not shown, a conditional setting's value is evaluated in the Liquid code. Code defensively, never assume a theme setting's value is nil.
      </conditional>

      <input_type>
        **Checkbox**: Treat checkbox as an on/off switch. Avoid using verb-based labels, example: use "Language selector" and not "Enable language selector". The presence of the verb may inadvertently suggest the direction to toggle to enable or disable it.

        **Select**: Keep select option labels as short as possible so they can be dynamically displayed as segmented controls
      </input_type>
    </information_architecture>
  </settings>

  <server_side_rendering>
    Storefronts are to be rendered server-side with Liquid as a first principle. As opposed to client-side JavaScript.

    When using JavaScript to render part of the page, fetch the new HTML from the server wherever possible.
    <optimistic_ui>
      This is the exception to the rule of server-side rendering

      "Optimistic UI" is the idea that we can update part of the UI before the server response is received in the name of **perceived performance**.

      <criteria>
        Key factors to consider when deciding whether to use optimistic UI:

        1. You are updating a **small** portion of the UI on the client (with JavaScript) before the server response is received.
        2. The API request has a high degree of certainty of being successful.

        Examples of appropriate use cases:

        When filtering a collection page, we can update the a list of applied filters client-side as a Buyer chooses them, i.e. "Color: Red" or "Size: Medium". However, we do not know how many products will be returned that match the filters, so we can't update the product grid or a count of products.

        When a Buyer attempts to add an item to their cart, we can update the cart item count client-side. Assuming our product form's "add to cart" button is already checking the item's availability, we can have a reasonably high degree of certainty that the item will be added to the cart (API request is successful). However, we do not know what the new cart total will be, nor do we know what the line items will look like, so we can't update those in a cart drawer without waiting for the server response.
      </criteria>
    </optimistic_ui>
  </server_side_rendering>
</ux_principles>


<html>
  - Use semantic HTML
  - Use modern HTML features where appropriate, e.g. use `<details>` and `<summary>` over JS to show and hide content
  - Use `CamelCase` for IDs. When appending a block or section ID, append `-{{ block.id }}` or `-{{ section.id }}` respectively

  <accessibility>
    - Ensure all interactive elements are focusable. e.g. if you use a label to style a checkbox, include `tabindex="0"`
    - Only use `tabindex="0"` unless absolutely necessary, to avoid hijacking tab flow
  </accessibility>
</html>


<css>
  <specificity>
    - Never use IDs as selectors
    - Avoid using elements as selectors
    - Avoid using !important at all costs - if you must use it, comment why in the code
    - Use a 0 1 0 specificity wherever possible, meaning a single .class selector
    - In cases where you must use higher specificity due to a parent/child relationship, try to keep the specificity to a maximum of 0 4 0
    - Note that this can sometimes be impossible due to the 0 1 0 specificity of pseudo-classes like :hover. There may be situations where .parent:hover .child is the only way to achieve the desired effect
    - Avoid complex selectors. A selector should be easy to understand at a glance. Don't over do it with pseudo selectors (:has, :where, :nth-child, etc)
  </specificity>

  <variables>
    - Use CSS variables (custom properties) to reduce redundancy and make updates easier
    - If hardcoding a value, set it to a variable first (e.g. --touch-target-size: 44px)
    - Never hardcode colors, always use color schemes
    - Scope variables to components unless they need to be global
    - Global variables should be in :root in snippets/theme-styles-variables.liquid
    - Scoped variables can reference global variables
  </variables>

  <scoping>
    - Prefer using {% stylesheet %} tags in sections, blocks, and snippets for the relevant CSS
    - Reset CSS variable values inline with style attributes for section/block settings
    - Avoid using {% style %} tags with block/section ID selectors
    - Use variables to reduce property assignment redundancy
  </scoping>

  <bem>
    - Use BEM naming convention:
      - Block: the component
      - Element: child of component (block__element)
      - Modifier: variant (block--modifier, block__element--modifier)
    - Use dashes to separate words in blocks/elements/modifiers
  </bem>

  <media-queries>
    - Default to mobile first (min-width queries)
    - Use screen for all media queries
  </media-queries>

  <nesting>
    - Do not use & operator
    - Never nest beyond first level
    - Exceptions:
      - Media queries should be nested
      - Parent-child relationships with multiple states/modifiers affecting children
    - Keep nesting simple and logical
  </nesting>
</css>


<javascript>
  <general_principles>
    - Lean towards using zero external dependencies
    - Use JS when needed, but reach for native browser features first
      - e.g. use "popover" or "details" over JS unless there is a good reason to do otherwise
    - Do not use "var"
    - Prefer "const" over "let" - avoid mutation unless necessary
    - Prefer "for (const thing of things)" over "things.forEach()"
    - Put new lines before new "blocks" of code. A block is anything with a "{" and "}"
  </general_principles>

  <file_structure>
    - Group scripts by feature area where appropriate
      - e.g. "facets.js" contains multiple classes related to facets, they don't each need to be their own file
  </file_structure>

  <modules>
    - Use the module pattern for loading JavaScript. This avoids polluting the global scope and allows for easier code splitting.

    <privacy_and_instance_methods>
      - The public API of a module should be the smallest possible surface to provide the necessary functionality
      - All other instance methods should be prefixed with "#" and are private
      - Do not use instance methods for functions that do not use the class instance

      <code>
        class MyClass {
          constructor() {

  </modules>

  <asynchronous_code>
    - Prefer to use "async/await" syntax
    - Prefer to use "await" over chaining ".then()"
  </asynchronous_code>

  <events>
    - Use events to communicate between custom elements. This avoids explicit dependencies.
  </events>

  <web_components>
    - Initialize JS components in the DOM using custom elements
      - This allows them to update when added into the DOM via the editor more seamlessly
    - Use of shadow DOM
    - Use of slots
  </web_components>

  <early_returns>
    - Prefer early returns over nested conditionals

    <optional_chaining>
      If you need to use multiple instances of Optional Chaining, prefer to use an early return instead.
      Single optional chain usage is acceptable.

      <code>
        // Multiple optional chains - use early return instead
        const button = this.querySelector('ref="button"');
        if (!button) return;
        button.enable();
        button.textContent = 'Add to cart';

        // Single optional chain is fine
        const button = this.querySelector('ref="button"');
        button?.enable();
      </code>
    </optional_chaining>
  </early_returns>

  <simplification>
    <ternaries>
      Use ternaries for simple if/else blocks where both the condition and body are simple:
      <code>
        simpleCondition ? this.doAThing() : this.doAnotherThing();
      </code>
    </ternaries>

    <one_liners>
      Write simple conditional returns on one line:
      <code>
        if (simpleCondition) return;
      </code>
    </one_liners>

    <returning_boolean>
      Return boolean comparisons directly rather than using ternaries:
      <code>
        return simpleCondition;
      </code>
    </returning_boolean>
  </simplification>
</javascript>
